# Definition
RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value, which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

# Overview
RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers‚Äô:

- recency (the date they made their last purchase)
- frequency (how often they make purchases)
- and monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)

Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

# RFM Customer Segments
## The above segments that we calculated are RFM value segments. Now we‚Äôll calculate RFM customer segments. The RFM value segment represents the categorization of customers based on their RFM scores into groups such as ‚Äúlow value‚Äù, ‚Äúmedium value‚Äù, and ‚Äúhigh value‚Äù. These segments are determined by dividing RFM scores into distinct ranges or groups, allowing for a more granular analysis of overall customer RFM characteristics. The RFM value segment helps us understand the relative value of customers in terms of recency, frequency, and monetary aspects.
